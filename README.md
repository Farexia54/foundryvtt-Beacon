The below credits are from Eranziel as their project allowed me to quickly do this.
"This project incorporates several resources and open source software (either in part or in whole). Without these, this project would be much poorer, and might not even exist in the first place. A huge thank you to all those who use their time and skills to enrich the world with their creations!
* [Comp/Con](https://compcon.app), the incredible companion app for Lancer, created by beeftime and ari. ([Github](https://github.com/massif-press/compcon))
